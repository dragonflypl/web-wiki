# You don't know JS

## [10 Interview Questions Every JavaScript Developer Should Know](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95)

- (1) Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?: OOP and FB
  - Worth to remember: “new considered harmful,” “inheritance considered harmful,” and “super is a code smell.”
  - [The Two Pillars of JavaScript Part 1 — Prototypal OO](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3) article (about new considered harmful, factories, drawbacks of classical inheritance, benefits of prototypal inheritance)
    - [Classical Inheritance is Obsolete - How to Think in Prototypal OO](https://vimeo.com/69255635) video
    - <https://stampit.js.org/> and <https://github.com/stampit-org/stampit> - create objects from reusable, composable behaviors. Supports three different kinds of prototypal inheritance (delegation, concatenation, and functional)
    - <https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/static-mem-pools/> + <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWmzxyMf2cE> - Static Memory Javascript with Object Pools
    - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WgVHE5Augc> - new considered harmful
  - [The Two Pillars of JavaScript — Pt 2: Functional Programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4)
  - [A General Theory of Reactivity](https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor) + [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p51PE1MZ8U)
  - [Learn RxJS](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/) - interactive learning of Reactive Extensions because the key to learning Rx is training yourself to use functional programming to manipulate collections
  - RxJs, http://highlandjs.org/ , Bacon.js - some Rx libraries
  - Laziness - means that streams / collections are processed one by one from the stream and functions start to execute only once somebody is interested in result (like subscription to an observable)

 ## TODO
 
 - <https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects> - another artile that criticizes classical inheritance
 - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p51PE1MZ8U) - A General Theory of Reactivity , watch again
 - [Learn RxJS](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/) - interactive learning of Reactive Extensions because the key to learning Rx is training yourself to use functional programming to manipulate collections
